# Google-Chrome-extension
This is my first experience with making a Chrome extension which work like book mark function on Chrome. It allows user to save the url of the current tab or any tabs and be able to access after click on the link of that URL.

Utilizing localStorage, JSON function to store data (key:value data type) permanently unless explicitly delete it.
Utilizing HTML and CSS for the UI, while using JS to handle the save current tab, add tab and delete all tabs from the memory.
