This is my first chrome extension. It works like built-in book mark function on Chrome. It allows me to save the url of any tabs that can be accessed immediately later on just by doing one click.
Utilizing localStorage to store url address permanently on browser unless explicitly delete through delete button
Using HTML and CSS for the UI and JS for handling logic relate to save provided url address to the localStorage, save url address of current tab and delete all tabs from local Storage
